Notes

- This repository contains a minimal static portfolio in the `portfolio/` folder. Replace placeholder text, images, and project links with your own content.
- The contact form on `contact.html` is a frontend demo (no backend); form submissions are logged to the browser console.
- To preview locally, open `portfolio/index.html` in a browser. On Windows PowerShell you can run:

```powershell
Start-Process -FilePath "c:\Users\yuvra\OneDrive\Desktop\github project\portfolio\index.html"
```

- To publish on GitHub Pages: push this repo to GitHub, then enable Pages for the `main` branch and set the folder to `/portfolio` (or use the repository root and move files accordingly).
